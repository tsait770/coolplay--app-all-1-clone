- Track device bindings

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies ensuring users can only:
- View their own data
- Update their own records
- Cannot access other users' information

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

1. **PayPal Credentials**: Never commit `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` to git
2. **Supabase Keys**: RLS policies protect user data
3. **Age Verification**: Stored in database with timestamps
4. **Device Binding**: Limits enforced at database level
5. **Quota Management**: Triggers prevent quota bypass
